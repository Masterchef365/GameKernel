1. Single bytes are sent over channels (probably a huge performance hit)
Modules cannot be killed
Modules can use as much memory and processing time as they'd like
Some bug with message lengths?
    In the new implementation, remember to make it so that when poll_flush is called the current buffer is actually fed into the channel regardless of length, otherwise you could get weird latency artefacts! 

Try reporting the count in plugin_a every 1000 or so and don't print ****

Test latency by doing a message timing

Check if you can just write without flushing
